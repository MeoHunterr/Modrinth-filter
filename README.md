# Modrinth Native Filter

A userscript that adds a native-style filtering UI to Modrinth.com, allowing users to hide mods based on specific tags (e.g., "Client", "Fabric") instantly without reloading the page.

## Features

- **Native UI:** Designed to match Modrinth's dark mode aesthetic.
- **Instant Filtering:** Hides unwanted mods immediately upon entering a tag.
- **Layout Fix:** Automatically adjusts the grid layout so there are no empty gaps.
- **Persistence:** Saves your blocked tags locally, so you don't have to re-enter them.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like **Tampermonkey** or **Violentmonkey**.
2. Click on the raw `.js` file in this repository or create a new script and paste the code.
3. Visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) to see the filter panel in the bottom right corner.
